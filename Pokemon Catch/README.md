# Project One

POKÉMON CATCH
Play as famed pokémon trainer, Red, as you try to catch as many pokémon as you can! Watch out, if you hit the Team Rocket Grunt you lose!
Use the arrow keys to move left to right across the bottom of the screen and press the W key to throw the pokéball.
The rocket grunt will pace back and forth on the screen hoping to block the trainer from catching the pokémon.
Pokémon will spawn and move across the top of the screen in the tall grass before disappearing off screen. Catch them before they're gone!

## MVP

- [ ] have a start screen that explains the game and controls and begins the game when "Start" is clicked
- [ ]  Have a box for the trainer that moves left to right with arrowkey inputs on the bottom of the game screen
- [ ] Have a box for the rocket grunt that moves back and forth in the middle of the game screen
- [ ] have a box that spawns and crosses left to right at the top of the game screen
- [ ] have a feature that allows a ball(another box) to be thrown with the W key
- [ ] have a detect hit function that ends the game if it hits the rocket grunt and makes the pokemon disappear if it hits the pokémon

## Stretch Goals
- [ ] Have a counter that keeps track of how many pokémon you have caught (score) in the top right
- [ ] have some sort of artwork on the boxes that display what they are
- [ ] have different pokémon sprites spawn randomly
- [ ] eventually make it a level system with a goal number to catch for each level and each level has a different team rocket count and location
- [ ] have the team rocket grunt and pokemon move at different speeds and the pokemon have a zigzag pattern to make it seem more "alive"
- [ ] include a new box after game over that displays game over and has a play again button


## Roadblocks
* I have a hard time with Javascript.
* My brain starts getting overwhelmed with all the different types of functions and remembering what goes where
* I don't really feel like I have any idea on how to accomplish this yet, but i am confident I will somehow present...something...
* I am struggling on how to search for answers correctly because I still don't think I have enough of a grasp to even know what I should look up. 
* I truthfully can't figure out how to work any of the online wireframing sites.. i also don't know if the wireframing i did on paper is right.
